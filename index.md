# Infinity Mirror Clock
I am working on an arduino Infinity Mirror Clock that uses LED's and mirrors in order to generate a cool looking clock. Other parts, like a time-keeping component and a numpad component used to set alarms will also be added.

# Final Milestone
My final milestone is the increased reliability and accuracy of my robot. I ameliorated the sagging and fixed the reliability of the finger. As discussed in my second milestone, the arm sags because of weight. I put in a block of wood at the base to hold up the upper arm; this has reverberating positive effects throughout the arm. I also realized that the forearm was getting disconnected from the elbow servo’s horn because of the weight stress on the joint. Now, I make sure to constantly tighten the screws at that joint.

# Second Milestone
My second milestone is adding various features, like an alarm, a numpad for inputting the alarm time, and an LCD screen for displaying the time and alarm. I first added an alarm, making so that when it goes off, the LEDs  turn rainbow for a few seconds and a buzzer plays a sound. Next, in order to make it easy for the user to input an alarm, I added a numpad. I made it so that in order to enter "alarm setting mode", one has to first press the star key before entering their desired time. Finally, in order for the user to easily see what they are entering, I added an LCD screen to display the alarm being set. Since I had already added the LCD screen anyways, I decided to display the time on it too, so that the user can easily see whether it is AM or PM.

# First Milestone
  
My first milestone is setting up and hooking up all the wires between my Arduino Uno, Neopixel strip, and clock component in order to make the Neopixel strip light up according to the time. Since my Neopixel strip is 60 LEDs long, I decided to make 1 light up for each second, 1 light up for each minute, and 5 light up for each hour(12-hour format like a standard clock). I also decided to make the seconds green, minutes red, and hours blue in order to easily differentiate the three. I also made it os that when the hours and minutes overlap, it turns purple, which adds more variety to the clock and also makes it clearer. In order to achieve all of this, I downloaded the Arduino softare off the internet and got to coding. To get a better understanding of the code, I made use of the example code to familiarize myself with the various methods of the many Libraries I used, including Adafruit Neopixel, DS3231, RTClib and more.
